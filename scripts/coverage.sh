# the repo root. Below the floor the gate fails — some change shipped without tests.
# Above it, the floor is raised to the new value (commit the file), which is what makes
# the ratchet a ratchet; with --check the floor is only verified, never rewritten, which
# is what CI runs.
#
# Usage:
#   scripts/coverage.sh          run, fail below the floor, raise it when above
#   scripts/coverage.sh --check  run, fail below the floor, never write (CI)
